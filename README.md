[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3a8b09c6acdb4e80bf652e9cee2f716a)](https://app.codacy.com/app/ariG23498/DigitalSignalProcessing?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ariG23498/DigitalSignalProcessing&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This repository will contain all my intuitions of the subject, simulated with `MATLAB` and `python`.

# Contents
* Elementary `Continuous` and `Discrete` Time Signals.
* Intuition as to why `LCM` of two periodic signals turns out to be the period of their superimposed signal.
* Energy and Power functions made.
* Aliasing
