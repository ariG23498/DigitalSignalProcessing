# DigitalSignalProcessing
This repository will contain all my intuitions of the subject, simulated with `MATLAB` and `python`.

# Contents
* Elementary `Continuous` and `Discrete` Time Signals.
* Intuition as to why `LCM` of two periodic signals turns out to be the period of their superimposed signal.
* Energy and Power functions made.
* Aliasing
