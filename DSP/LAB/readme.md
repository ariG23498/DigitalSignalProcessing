# DSP Lab experiments
This folder contains `functions` as well as `scripts` for the experiments.

## Functions
1. Discrete Fourier Transform
2. Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
3. Z-Transform
4. Linear Convolution -- without using conv()
5. Circular Convolution -- without using cconv()

## Scripts
1. Verification of the `properties` of Z-Transform
2. Verification of the `properties` of Linear Convolution
3. Sminulation and verification of Twiddle Factor `Wn` in case of DFT
